Maintenance Optimization Problem

A mixed integer optimization model for maintenance operations to minimize the Total Cost and obtain the optimal value of decesion variables.
The model consists of 13 constraints, 13 decesion variables and an objective function.
The data for this specific code is confidentail so I did not share it.
